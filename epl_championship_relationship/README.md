## Premier League-Championship links
A project to compare Premier League and Championship interaction over time for this issue [insert link afterwards] of the Get Goalside newsletter

I ended up scraping FBref to look through players' career histories, doing some simple addition of the number of 'seasons' that they spent in each league and the sum of their league minutes. FBref's data goes back quite a long way, covering a lot of leagues, so for this kind of analysis it should have caught the majority of career histories.

It's not perfect - there's a particularly annoying workaround I had to do with leagues which share the name of ones I'm interested in - but I _think_ it's ok. 

All of the csvs were created through the `create_data.py` file, and the `analyse_data.py` has the latest version of the results commented in the file so I could keep track of them. There's also an xlsx file which I used elsewhere in the newsletter that this project was for.
